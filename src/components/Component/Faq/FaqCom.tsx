                  We don't produce high-quality design artifacts as part of our

                  resources means we can't spend as much time creating new
                  examples in code which is where we believe we can provide the
                  most value.

                  All of the components in Tailwind UI are provided in three

                    Headless UI â€”{" "}
                  </Link>{" "}
                  a library of unstyled components we designed to integrate
                  perfectly with Tailwind CSS. Headless UI supports both React
                  and Vue 4, but is not compatible with Vue 2.

                  and are designed for people who prefer to write any necessary
                  JavaScript themselves.

                  Most of the components do not rely on JS at all, but for the
                  ones that do (dropdowns, modals, etc.) we've provided some
                  simple comments in the HTML to explain things like what
                  classes you need to use for different states (like a toggle
                  switch being on or off), or what classes we recommend for
                  transitioning elements on to or off of the screen (like a
                  modal opening).
